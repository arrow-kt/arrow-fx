/**
 * A way to safely acquire a resource and release in the face of errors and cancellation.
 * It uses [ExitCase] to distinguish between different exit cases when releasing the acquired resource.
 *
 * [bracketCase] exists out of a three stages:
 *   1. acquisition
 *   2. consumption
 *   3. releasing
 *
 * 1. Resource acquisition is **NON CANCELLABLE**.
 *   If resource acquisition fails, meaning no resource was actually successfully acquired then we short-circuit the effect.
 *   Reason being, we cannot [release] what we did not `acquire` first. Same reason we cannot call [use].
 *   If it is successful we pass the result to stage 2 [use].
 *
 * 2. Resource consumption is like any other `suspend` effect. The key difference here is that it's wired in such a way that
 *   [release] **will always** be called either on [ExitCase.Cancelled], [ExitCase.Failure] or [ExitCase.Completed].
 *   If it failed than the resulting [suspend] from [bracketCase] will be the error, otherwise the result of [use].
 *
 * 3. Resource releasing is **NON CANCELLABLE**, otherwise it could result in leaks.
 *   In the case it throws the resulting [suspend] will be either the error or a composed error if one occurred in the [use] stage.
 *
 * @param acquire the action to acquire the resource
 *
 * @param use is the action to consume the resource and produce a result.
 * Once the resulting suspend program terminates, either successfully, error or disposed,
 * the [release] function will run to clean up the resources.
 *
 * @param release the allocated resource after [use] terminates.
