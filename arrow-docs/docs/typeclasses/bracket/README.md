## Bracket




The `Bracket` Type class abstracts the ability to safely **acquire**, **use**, and then **release** a resource.

Essentially, it could be considered the functional programming equivalent to the well known imperative
`try/catch/finally` structure:

```kotlin
val resource = acquire() // See note below
try {
  use(resource)
} finally {
  release(resource)
}
```

Note here that acquiring is not a safe op and thus it might fail. An alternative use of Bracket in this sense would be the `guarantee` function explained below.

`Bracket` extends [`MonadError`]({{ '/arrow/typeclasses/monaderror' | relative_url }}).

It ensures that the acquired resource is released at the end after using it, **even if the using action throws an error**.
That ensures that no errors are swallowed.

Another key point of `Bracket` would be the ability to abstract over whether the resource is going to be used
synchronously or asynchronously.

### Example

Let's say we want to work with a file. Let's use a mock `File` API to avoid messing with the real one here.

These methods allow us to open a file, close it, and also read its content as a string.

```kotlin:ank:silent
import arrow.fx.IO

/**
 * Mock File API.
 */
class File(url: String) {
    fun open(): File = this
    fun close(): Unit {}
    override fun toString(): String = "This file contains some interesting content!"
}

fun openFile(uri: String): IO<File> = IO { File(uri).open() }

fun closeFile(file: File): IO<Unit> = IO { file.close() }

fun fileToString(file: File): IO<String> = IO { file.toString() }
```

Note that we wrapped them into [`IO`]({{ '/effects/io' | relative_url }}). [`IO`]({{ '/effects/io' | relative_url }})
is able to wrap any side effecting computation to make it pure. In a real world system, these operations would contain
side effects since they'd end up accessing the file system.

Read the [`IO`]({{ '/effects/io' | relative_url }}) docs for more context on this.

Now, let's say we want to open a file, do some work with it, and then close it. With `Bracket`, we could make that
process look like this:

```kotlin:ank:playground
import arrow.fx.IO

class File(url: String) {
    fun open(): File = this
    fun close(): Unit {}
    override fun toString(): String = "This file contains some interesting content!"
}

fun openFile(uri: String): IO<File> = IO { File(uri).open() }

fun closeFile(file: File): IO<Unit> = IO { file.close() }

fun fileToString(file: File): IO<String> = IO { file.toString() }

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
//sampleStart
val safeComputation = openFile("data.json").bracket(
    release = { file -> closeFile(file) },
    use = { file -> fileToString(file) })
//sampleEnd
println(safeComputation)
}
```

This would ensure the file gets closed right after completing the `use` operation, which would be `fileToString(file)`
here. If that operation throws an error, the file would also be closed.

Note that the result is still an `IO.Async` operation, which means it's still deferred (not executed yet).

### Polymorphic example

We've mentioned that `Bracket` is agnostic to whether the `use` lambda is computed synchronously or asynchronously.
That's because it's able to run over any data type `F` that can support synchronous and asynchronous
computations, like [`IO`]({{ '/effects/io' | relative_url }}) or [`Observable`]({{ '/integrations/rx2' | relative_url }}).

It basically targets what is known as a "Higher Kind" in Functional Programming.

There's a complete [section about this pattern]({{ '/patterns/polymorphic_programs' | relative_url }}) in the
docs.

Let's learn more about how `Bracket` can support this pattern as a Type class with a basic example showcasing this high level of abstraction technique.

```kotlin:ank:silent
import arrow.Kind
import arrow.fx.typeclasses.Bracket

class File(url: String) {
  fun open(): File = this
  fun close(): Unit {}
  override fun toString(): String = "This file contains some interesting content!"
}

class Program<F>(BF: Bracket<F, Throwable>) : Bracket<F, Throwable> by BF {

  fun openFile(uri: String): Kind<F, File> = just(File(uri).open())

  fun closeFile(file: File): Kind<F, Unit> = just(file.close())

  fun fileToString(file: File): Kind<F, String> = just(file.toString())
}
```

This is basically the same program from previous examples, but defined over any `F` data type for which there is an instance
of `Bracket`. In other words, this program is constrained by the capabilities that `Bracket` can provide.

We are also fixing the error type from `Bracket<F, E>` to be `Throwable`.

Let's run the program for the three mentioned data types as an example of polymorphism now.

We can run the program for `IO`:

```kotlin:ank:playground
import arrow.fx.IO
import arrow.fx.extensions.io.bracket.bracket
import arrow.Kind
import arrow.fx.typeclasses.Bracket

class File(url: String) {
  fun open(): File = this
  fun close(): Unit {}
  override fun toString(): String = "This file contains some interesting content!"
}

class Program<F>(BF: Bracket<F, Throwable>) : Bracket<F, Throwable> by BF {

  fun openFile(uri: String): Kind<F, File> = just(File(uri).open())

  fun closeFile(file: File): Kind<F, Unit> = just(file.close())

  fun fileToString(file: File): Kind<F, String> = just(file.toString())
}

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
//sampleStart
val ioProgram = Program(IO.bracket())

val safeComputation = with (ioProgram) {
  openFile("data.json").bracket(
    release = { file -> closeFile(file) },
    use = { file -> fileToString(file) })
}
//sampleEnd
println(safeComputation)
}
```

Now let's also run the exact same program for `ObservableK`:

```kotlin:ank:playground
import arrow.fx.rx2.ObservableK
import arrow.fx.rx2.extensions.observablek.bracket.bracket
import arrow.Kind
import arrow.fx.typeclasses.Bracket

class File(url: String) {
  fun open(): File = this
  fun close(): Unit {}
  override fun toString(): String = "This file contains some interesting content!"
}

class Program<F>(BF: Bracket<F, Throwable>) : Bracket<F, Throwable> by BF {

  fun openFile(uri: String): Kind<F, File> = just(File(uri).open())

  fun closeFile(file: File): Kind<F, Unit> = just(file.close())

  fun fileToString(file: File): Kind<F, String> = just(file.toString())
}

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
//sampleStart
val observableProgram = Program(ObservableK.bracket())

val safeComputation = with (observableProgram) {
  openFile("data.json").bracket(
    release = { file -> closeFile(file) },
    use = { file -> fileToString(file) })
}
//sampleEnd
println(safeComputation)
}
```

Note that we're running the exact same program passing in two different data types. All of them can provide an
instance of `Bracket`, which means that they can support asynchronous and synchronous computations.

This is the style you'd usually use in a Functional Program.

### Combinators

#### bracket

Requires passing `release` and `use` lambdas. It ensures acquiring, using, and releasing the resource at the end.

`fun <A, B> Kind<F, A>.bracket(release: (A) -> Kind<F, Unit>, use: (A) -> Kind<F, B>): Kind<F, B>`

```kotlin:ank:playground
import arrow.fx.IO

class File(url: String) {
    fun open(): File = this
    fun close(): Unit {}
    override fun toString(): String = "This file contains some interesting content!"
}

fun openFile(uri: String): IO<File> = IO { File(uri).open() }

fun closeFile(file: File): IO<Unit> = IO { file.close() }

fun fileToString(file: File): IO<String> = IO { file.toString() }

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
//sampleStart
val safeComputation = openFile("data.json").bracket(
  release = { file -> closeFile(file) },
  use = { file -> fileToString(file) })
//sampleEnd
println(safeComputation)
}
```

#### bracketCase

It's a generalized version of `bracket()` that uses `ExitCase` to distinguish between different exit cases when
releasing the acquired resource. `ExitCase` can take the values `Completed`, `Canceled`, or `Error(e)`.  So, depending
how the `use` execution finalizes, the corresponding `ExitCase` value will be passed to the `release` lambda.

It requires passing `release` and `use` lambdas. It ensures acquiring, using, and releasing the resource at the end.

`fun <A, B> Kind<F, A>.bracketCase(release: (A, ExitCase<Throwable>) -> Kind<F, Unit>, use: (A) -> Kind<F, B>): Kind<F, B>`

```kotlin:ank:playground
import arrow.fx.IO
import arrow.fx.typeclasses.ExitCase

class File(url: String) {
    fun open(): File = this
    fun close(): Unit {}
    override fun toString(): String = "This file contains some interesting content!"
}

fun openFile(uri: String): IO<File> = IO { File(uri).open() }

fun closeFile(file: File): IO<Unit> = IO { file.close() }

fun fileToString(file: File): IO<String> = IO { file.toString() }

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
//sampleStart
val safeComputation = openFile("data.json").bracketCase(
    release = { file, exitCase ->
      when (exitCase) {
        is ExitCase.Completed -> { /* do something */ }
        is ExitCase.Canceled -> { /* do something */ }
        is ExitCase.Error -> { /* do something */ }
      }
      closeFile(file)
    },
    use = { file ->
      fileToString(file)
    })
//sampleEnd
println(safeComputation)
}
```

#### guarantee/guaranteeCase - onCancel/onError

Ignores the acquisition and focuses on using a resource and performing an action whenever it finishes in any way (completed, error, canceled).

Similarly as for `bracketCase`, `guaranteeCase` works in the same way as `guarantee` but uses `ExitCase` to distinguish between different exit cases when
releasing the acquired resource.

Although you would normally not need to use `guarantee`, since there are 2 combinators (onCancel/onError) that exist now to fulfill typical control flow handling:

`fun <A> Kind<F, A>.onCancel(finalizer: Kind<F, Unit>): Kind<F, A>`

`fun <A> Kind<F, A>.onError(finalizer: Kind<F, Unit>): Kind<F, A>`

Note how the finalizer's return type is `Unit` because it won't change the result type of our initial operation, but rather execute another in a specific case.

For example, imagine that we need to keep track of whether our data-fetching operation fails or is cancelled due to some event, we would simply do:

```kotlin:ank:playground
import arrow.fx.IO
import arrow.fx.extensions.io.bracket.onCancel
import arrow.fx.extensions.io.bracket.onError

// Some important operation
fun myOp() = IO { 42 }

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
//sampleStart
val safeComputation = myOp()
  .onCancel(IO { println("cancelled!") })
  .onError { e -> IO { println("error: $e!") } }
//sampleEnd
println(safeComputation)
}

```

#### Other combinators

For a full list of other useful combinators available in `Bracket`, see the [Source][bracket_source]{:target="_blank"}

### Laws

Arrow provides [`BracketLaws`][bracket_laws_source]{:target="_blank"} in the form of test cases for internal
verification of lawful instances and third party apps creating their own Bracket instances.

#### Creating your own `Bracket` instances

Arrow already provides Bracket instances for most common datatypes both in Arrow and the Kotlin stdlib.
Oftentimes, you may find the need to provide your own for unsupported datatypes.

You may create or automatically derive instances of `Bracket` for your own datatypes, which you will be able to use in
the context of abstract polymorphic code.

See [Deriving and creating custom typeclass]({{ '/patterns/glossary' | relative_url }})
